# arrobavolver-chat

A hands-on product + UX + frontend prototype for an AI assistant chat experience.

This repository represents an execution-focused exploration by a senior Product & Technology professional:
from problem framing and conversation design to a working UI prototype.

## What this is
- A lightweight chat UI (HTML) to prototype an assistant experience
- A space to validate: user flows, UX decisions, and interaction patterns
- A foundation to evolve into a more complete product (backend, integrations, persistence, analytics)

## Why it matters
Great AI experiences are not only model quality — they are:
- clear user intent handling
- fallbacks and recovery
- interaction pacing and tone
- information architecture and UI clarity

This repo is a practical artifact to iterate on those decisions.

## Scope (current)
- Chat UI prototype
- Basic flow exploration (intents / message patterns)

## Next steps (roadmap)
- Add conversation flow map (intents, fallbacks, guardrails)
- Add UI states: loading, errors, empty state, history
- Add basic telemetry plan (events to measure UX)
- Optional backend: API layer + integrations
